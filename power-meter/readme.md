This is my version of a non-invasive power meter.

I've used Home Assistant Glow for a while without problems. Suddenly I start to get crazy high spikes, in the reported power consumption, every day at around the same time (weird). I had to chase that down and started to look at the code. This is the result.

The excellent Home Assistant Glow can be found here:
