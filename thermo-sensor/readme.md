A thermo-sensor using an AMG8833 sensor hooked up to an ESP.

This is heavily inspired by the ESPHome custom component created by TheRealWaldo.

You can find his repository here: https://github.com/TheRealWaldo/AMG8833-ESPHOME

I use an ESP32 (Wemos D1 ESP32) with the AMG8833 connected to pin 21 and 22 (sda and scl).
