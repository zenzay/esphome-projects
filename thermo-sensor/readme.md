Thermo-Sensor
=============

## A thermo-sensor using an AMG8833 sensor hooked up to an ESP32. ##

This is heavily inspired by the ESPHome custom component [AMG8833-ESPHOME](https://github.com/TheRealWaldo/AMG8833-ESPHOME) created by TheRealWaldo.

This is work in progress as I'm hoping to improve on the detection technique.
