# Power Meter LED #

## A ESPHome custom component that attempts to simulate the flashing LED on a Power Meter. ##

These LEDs usually pulse with either 1000 or 10000 pulses per kWh, and thus we can simulate this with our own LED and an ESP32.

I initially created a simple Arduino Sketch to simulate a fixed power consumption, but needed to learn how to make custom components in ESPHome, so here we are.
